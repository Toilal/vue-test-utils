clone our demo repository with basic setup and install the dependencies:\ngit clone https://github.com/vuejs/vue-test-utils-getting-started\ncd vue-test-utils-getting-started\nnpm install\n\nYou will see that the project includes a simple component, counter.js:\n// counter.js\n\nexport default {\n  template: `\n    \n      {{ count }}\n      Increment\n    \n  `,\n\n  data () {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  },\n\n  methods: {\n    increment () {\n      this.count++\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nMounting Components\nvue-test-utils tests Vue components by mounting them in isolation, mocking the necessary inputs (props, injections and user events) and asserting the outputs (render result, emitted custom events).\nMounted components are returned inside a Wrapper, which exposes many convenience methods for manipulating, traversing and querying the underlying Vue component instance.\nYou can create wrappers using the mount method. Let's create a file called test.js:\n// test.js\n\n// Import the `mount()` method from the test utils\n// and the component you want to test\nimport { mount } from 'vue-test-utils'\nimport Counter from './counter'\n\n// Now mount the component and you have the wrapper\nconst wrapper = mount(Counter)\n\n// You can access the actual Vue instance via `wrapper.vm`\nconst vm = wrapper.vm\n\n// To inspect the wrapper deeper just log it to the console\n// and your adventure with the `vue-test-utils` begins\nconsole.log(wrapper)\n\nTest rendered HTML output of the component\nNow that we have the wrapper, the first thing we can do is to verify that the rendered HTML output of the component matches what is expected.\nimport { mount } from 'vue-test-utils'\nimport Counter from './counter'\n\ndescribe('Counter', () => {\n  // Now mount the component and you have the wrapper\n  const wrapper = mount(Counter)\n\n  it('renders the correct markup', () => {\n    expect(wrapper.html()).toContain('0')\n  })\n\n  // it's also easy to check for the existence of elements\n  it('has a button', () => {\n    expect(wrapper.contains('button')).toBe(true)\n  })\n})\n\nNow run the tests with npm test. You should see the tests passing.\nSimulating User Interaction\nOur counter should increment the count when the user clicks the button. To simulate the behavior, we need to first locate the button with wrapper.find(), which returns a wrapper for the button element. We can then simulate the click by calling .trigger() on the button wrapper:\nit('button click should increment the count', () => {\n  expect(wrapper.vm.count).toBe(0)\n  const button = wrapper.find('button')\n  button.trigger('click')\n  expect(wrapper.vm.count).toBe(1)\n})\n\nWhat about nextTick?\nVue batches pending DOM updates and applies them asynchronously to prevent unnecessary re-renders caused by multiple data mutations. This is why in practice we often have to use Vue.nextTick to wait until Vue has performed the actual DOM update after we trigger some state change.\nTo simplify usage, vue-test-utils applies all updates synchronously so you don't need to use Vue.nextTick to wait for DOM updates in your tests.\nNote: nextTick is still necessary when you need to explictly advance the event loop, for operations such as asynchronous callbacks or promise resolution.\nIf you do still need to use nextTick in your test files, be aware that any errors thrown inside it may not be caught by your test runner as it uses promises internally. There are two approaches to fixing this: either you can set the done callback as Vue's global error handler at the start of the test, or you can call nextTick without an argument and return it as a promise:\n// this will not be caught\nit('will time out', (done) => {\n  Vue.nextTick(() => {\n    expect(true).toBe(false)\n    done()\n  })\n})\n\n// the two following tests will work as expected\nit('will catch the error using done', (done) => {\n  Vue.config.errorHandler = done\n  Vue.nextTick(() => {\n    expect(true).toBe(false)\n    done()\n  })\n})\n\nit('will catch the error using a promise', () => {\n  return Vue.nextTick()\n    .then(function () {\n      expect(true).toBe(false)\n    })\n})\n\nWhat's Next\n\nIntegrate vue-test-utils into your project by choosing a test runner.\nLearn more about common techniques when writing tests.\n\n"},"guides/common-tips.html":{"url":"guides/common-tips.html","title":"Common Tips","keywords":"","body":"Common Tips\nKnowing What to Test\nFor UI components, we don't recommend aiming for complete line-based coverage, because it leads to too much focus on the internal implementation details of the components and could result in brittle tests.\nInstead, we recommend writing tests that assert your component's public interface, and treat its internals as a black box. A single test case would assert that some input (user interaction or change of props) provided to the component results in the expected output (render result or emitted custom events).\nFor example, for the Counter component which increments a display counter by 1 each time a button is clicked, its test case would simulate the click and assert that the rendered output has increased by 1. The test doesn't care about how the Counter increments the value, it only cares about the input and the output.\nThe benefit of this approach is that as long as your component's public interface remains the same, your tests will pass no matter how the component's internal implementation changes over time.\nThis topic is discussed with more details in a great presentation by Matt O'Connell.\nShallow Rendering\nIn unit tests, we typically want to focus on the component being tested as an isolated unit and avoid indirectly asserting the behavior of its child components.\nIn addition, for components that contain many child components, the entire rendered tree can get really big. Repeatedly rendering all child components could slow down our tests.\nvue-test-utils allows you to mount a component without rendering its child components (by stubbing them) with the shallow method:\nimport { shallow } from 'vue-test-utils'\n\nconst wrapper = shallow(Component) // returns a Wrapper containing a mounted Component instance\nwrapper.vm // the mounted Vue instance\n\nAsserting Emitted Events\nEach mounted wrapper automatically records all events emitted by the underlying Vue instance. You can retrieve the recorded events using the wrapper.emitted() method:\nwrapper.vm.$emit('foo')\nwrapper.vm.$emit('foo', 123)\n\n/*\n`wrapper.emitted()` returns the following object:\n{\n  foo: [[], [123]]\n}\n*/\n\nYou can then make assertions based on these data:\nimport { expect } from 'chai'\n\n// assert event has been emitted\nexpect(wrapper.emitted().foo).toBeTruthy()\n\n// assert event count\nexpect(wrapper.emitted().foo.length).toBe(2)\n\n// assert event payload\nexpect(wrapper.emitted().foo[1]).toEqual([123])\n\nYou can also get an Array of the events in their emit order by calling wrapper.emittedByOrder().\nManipulating Component State\nYou can directly manipulate the state of the component using the setData or setProps method on the wrapper:\nwrapper.setData({ count: 10 })\n\nwrapper.setProps({ foo: 'bar' })\n\nMocking Props\nYou can pass props to the component using Vue's built-in propsData option:\nimport { mount } from 'vue-test-utils'\n\nmount(Component, {\n  propsData: {\n    aProp: 'some value'\n  }\n})\n\nYou can also update the props of an already-mounted component with the wrapper.setProps({}) method.\nFor a full list of options, please see the mount options section of the docs.\nApplying Global Plugins and Mixins\nSome of the components may rely on features injected by a global plugin or mixin, for example vuex and vue-router.\nIf you are writing tests for components in a specific app, you can setup the same global plugins and mixins once in the entry of your tests. But in some cases, for example testing a generic component suite that may get shared across different apps, it's better to test your components in a more isolated setup, without polluting the global Vue constructor. We can use the createLocalVue method to achieve that:\nimport { createLocalVue } from 'vue-test-utils'\n\n// create an extended `Vue` constructor\nconst localVue = createLocalVue()\n\n// install plugins as normal\nlocalVue.use(MyPlugin)\n\n// pass the `localVue` to the mount options\nmount(Component, {\n  localVue\n})\n\nMocking Injections\nAnother strategy for injected props is simply mocking them. You can do that with the mocks option:\nimport { mount } from 'vue-test-utils'\n\nconst $route = {\n  path: '/',\n  hash: '',\n  params: { id: '123' },\n  query: { q: 'hello' }\n}\n\nmount(Component, {\n  mocks: {\n    $route // adds the mocked `$route` object to the Vue instance before mounting component\n  }\n})\n\nDealing with Routing\nSince routing by definition has to do with the overall structure of the application and involves multiple components, it is best tested via integration or end-to-end tests. For individual components that rely on vue-router features, you can mock them using the techniques mentioned above.\n"},"guides/dom-events.html":{"url":"guides/dom-events.html","title":"Mouse, Key and other DOM Events","keywords":"","body":"Testing Key, Mouse and other DOM events\nTrigger events\nThe Wrapper expose a trigger method.

It's test runner agnostic.\nThere are a few things to consider when choosing a test runner though: feature set, performance, and support for single-file component (SFC) pre-compilation. After carefully comparing existing libraries, here are two test runners that we recommend:\n\nJest is the most fully featured test runner. It requires the least configuration, sets up JSDOM by default, provides built-in assertions, and has a great command line user experience. However, you will need a preprocessor to be able to import SFC components in your tests. We have created the vue-jest preprocessor which can handle most common SFC features, but it currently does not have 100% feature parity with vue-loader.\n\nmocha-webpack is a wrapper around webpack + Mocha, but with a more streamlined interface and watch mode. The benefits of this setup is that we can get complete SFC support via webpack + vue-loader, but it requires more configuration upfront.\n\n\nBrowser Environment\nvue-test-utils relies on a browser environment. Technically you can run it in a real browser, but it's not recommended due to the complexity of launching real browsers on different platforms. Instead, we recommend running the tests in Node with a virtual browser environment using JSDOM.\nThe Jest test runner sets up JSDOM automatically. For other test runners, you can manually set up JSDOM for the tests using jsdom-global in the entry for your tests:\nnpm install --save-dev jsdom jsdom-global\n\n\n// in test setup / entry\nrequire('jsdom-global')()\n\nTesting Single-File Components\nSingle-file Vue components (SFCs) require pre-compilation before they can be run in Node or in the browser. There are two recommended ways to perform the compilation: with a Jest preprocessor, or directly use webpack.\nThe vue-jest preprocessor supports basic SFC functionalities, but currently does not handle style blocks or custom blocks, which are only supported in vue-loader. If you rely on these features or other webpack-specific configurations, you will need to use a webpack + vue-loader based setup.\nRead the following guides for different setups:\n\nTesting SFCs with Jest\nTesting SFCs with Mocha + webpack\n\nResources\n\nTest runner performance comparison\nExample project with Jest\nExample project with Mocha\nExample project with tape\nExample project with AVA\ntyu - Delightful web testing by egoist\n\n"},"guides/testing-SFCs-with-jest.html":{"url":"guides/testing-SFCs-with-jest.html","title":"Testing SFCs with Jest","keywords":"","body":"Testing Single File Components with Jest\n\nAn example project for this setup is available on GitHub.\n\nJest is a test runner developed by Facebook, aiming to deliver a battery-included unit testing solution. You can learn more about Jest on its official documentation.\nSetting up Jest\nWe will assume you are starting with a setup that already has webpack, vue-loader and Babel properly configured - e.g. the webpack-simple template scaffolded by vue-cli.\nThe first thing to do is install Jest and vue-test-utils:\n$ npm install --save-dev jest vue-test-utils\n\nNext we need to define a unit script in our package.json.\n// package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"jest\"\n  }\n}\n\nProcessing SFCs in Jest\nTo teach Jest how to process *.vue files, we will need to install and configure the vue-jest preprocessor:\nnpm install --save-dev vue-jest\n\nNext, create a jest block in package.json:\n{\n  // ...\n  \"jest\": {\n    \"moduleFileExtensions\": [\n      \"js\",\n      \"json\",\n      // tell Jest to handle `*.vue` files\n      \"vue\"\n    ],\n    \"transform\": {\n      // process `*.vue` files with `vue-jest`\n      \".*\\\\.(vue)$\": \"/node_modules/vue-jest\"\n    },\n    \"mapCoverage\": true\n  }\n}\n\n\nNote: vue-jest currently does not support all the features of vue-loader, for example custom block support and style loading. In addition, some webpack-specific features such as code-splitting are not supported either. To use them, read the guide on testing SFCs with Mocha + webpack.\n\nHandling webpack Aliases\nIf you use a resolve alias in the webpack config, e.g. aliasing @ to /src, you need to add a matching config for Jest as well, using the moduleNameMapper option:\n{\n  // ...\n  \"jest\": {\n    // ...\n    // support the same @ -> src alias mapping in source code\n    \"moduleNameMapper\": {\n      \"^@/(.*)$\": \"/src/$1\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nConfiguring Babel for Jest\n\nAlthough latest versions of Node already supports most ES2015 features, you may still want to use ES modules syntax and stage-x features in your tests. For that we need to install babel-jest:\nnpm install --save-dev babel-jest\n\nNext, we need to tell Jest to process JavaScript test files with babel-jest by adding an entry under jest.transform in package.json:\n{\n  // ...\n  \"jest\": {\n    // ...\n    \"transform\": {\n      // ...\n      // process js with `babel-jest`\n      \"^.+\\\\.js$\": \"/node_modules/babel-jest\"\n    },\n    // ...\n  }\n}\n\n\nBy default, babel-jest automatically configures itself as long as it's installed. However, because we have explicitly added a transform for *.vue files, we now need to explicitly configure babel-jest as well.\n\nAssuming using babel-preset-env with webpack, the default Babel config disables ES modules transpilation because webpack already knows how to handle ES modules. However, we do need to enable it for our tests because Jest tests run directly in Node.\nAlso, we can tell babel-preset-env to target the Node version we are using. This skips transpiling unnecessary features and makes our tests boot faster.\nTo apply these options only for tests, put them in a separate config under env.test (this will be automatically picked up by babel-jest).\nExample .babelrc:\n{\n  \"presets\": [\n    [\"env\", { \"modules\": false }]\n  ],\n  \"env\": {\n    \"test\": {\n      \"presets\": [\n        [\"env\", { \"targets\": { \"node\": \"current\" }}]\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nSnapshot Testing\nYou can use vue-server-renderer to render a component into a string so that it can be saved as a snapshot for Jest snapshot testing.\nThe render result of vue-server-renderer includes a few SSR-specific attributes, and it ignores whitespaces, making it harder to scan a diff. We can improve the saved snapshot with a custom serializer:\nnpm install --save-dev jest-serializer-vue\n\nThen configure it in package.json:\n{\n  // ...\n  \"jest\": {\n    // ...\n    // serializer for snapshots\n    \"snapshotSerializers\": [\n      \"/node_modules/jest-serializer-vue\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nPlacing Test Files\nBy default, Jest will recursively pick up all files that have a .spec.js or .test.js extension in the entire project. If this does not fit your needs, it's possible to change the testRegex in the config section in the package.json file.\nJest recommends creating a __tests__ directory right next to the code being tested, but feel free to structure your tests as you see fit. Just beware that Jest would create a __snapshots__ directory next to test files that performs snapshot testing.\nCoverage\nJest can be used to generate coverage reports in multiple formats. The following is a simple example to get started with:\nExtend your jest config (usually in package.json or jest.config.js) with the collectCoverage option, and then add the collectCoverageFrom array to define the files for which coverage information should be collected. You'll also want mapCoverage to be true, for coverage data to be accurate.\n{\n  \"jest\": {\n    // ...\n    \"collectCoverage\": true,\n    \"collectCoverageFrom\": [\n      \"**/*.{js,vue}\",\n      \"!**/node_modules/**\"\n    ],\n    \"mapCoverage\": true\n  }\n}\n\nThis will enable coverage reports with the default coverage reporters. You can customise these with the coverageReporters option:\n{\n  \"jest\": {\n    // ...\n    \"coverageReporters\": [\"html\", \"text-summary\"]\n  }\n}\n\nFurther documentation can be found in the Jest configuration documentation, where you can find options for coverage thresholds, target output directories, etc.\nExample Spec\nIf you are familiar with Jasmine, you should feel right at home with Jest's assertion API:\nimport { mount } from 'vue-test-utils'\nimport Component from './component'\n\ndescribe('Component', () => {\n  test('is a Vue instance', () => {\n    const wrapper = mount(Component)\n    expect(wrapper.isVueInstance()).toBeTruthy()\n  })\n})\n\nResources\n\nExample project for this setup\nExamples and slides from Vue Conf 2017\nJest\nBabel preset env\n\n"},"guides/testing-SFCs-with-mocha-webpack.html":{"url":"guides/testing-SFCs-with-mocha-webpack.html","title":"Testing SFCs with Mocha + webpack","keywords":"","body":"Testing Single File Components with Mocha + webpack\n\nAn example project for this setup is available on GitHub.\n\nAnother strategy for testing SFCs is compiling all our tests via webpack and then run it in a test runner. The advantage of this approach is that it gives us full support for all webpack and vue-loader features, so we don't have to make compromises in our source code.\nYou can technically use any test runner you like and manually wire things together, but we've found mocha-webpack to provide a very streamlined experience for this particular task.\nSetting Up mocha-webpack\nWe will assume you are starting with a setup that already has webpack, vue-loader and Babel properly configured - e.g. the webpack-simple template scaffolded by vue-cli.\nThe first thing to do is installing test dependencies:\nnpm install --save-dev vue-test-utils mocha mocha-webpack\n\nNext we need to define a test script in our package.json.\n// package.json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"mocha-webpack --webpack-config webpack.config.js --require test/setup.js test/**/*.spec.js\"\n  }\n}\n\nA few things to note here:\n\nThe --webpack-config flag specifies the webpack config file to use for the tests. In most cases, this would be identical to the config you use for the actual project with one small tweak. We will talk about this later.\n\nThe --require flag ensures the file test/setup.js is run before any tests, in which we can setup the global environment for our tests to be run in.\n\nThe final argument is a glob for the test files to be included in the test bundle.\n\n\nExtra webpack Configuration\nExternalizing NPM Dependencies\nIn our tests we will likely import a number of NPM dependencies - some of these modules may be written without browser usage in mind and simply cannot be bundled properly by webpack. Another consideration is externalizing dependencies greatly improves test boot up speed. We can externalize all NPM dependencies with webpack-node-externals:\n// webpack.config.js\nconst nodeExternals = require('webpack-node-externals')\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  externals: [nodeExternals()]\n}\n\nSource Maps\nSource maps need to be inlined to be picked up by mocha-webpack. The recommended config is:\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  devtool: 'inline-cheap-module-source-map'\n}\n\nIf debugging via IDE, it's also recommended to add the following:\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ...\n  output: {\n    // ...\n    // use absolute paths in sourcemaps (important for debugging via IDE)\n    devtoolModuleFilenameTemplate: '[absolute-resource-path]',\n    devtoolFallbackModuleFilenameTemplate: '[absolute-resource-path]?[hash]'\n  }\n}\n\nSetting Up Browser Environment\nvue-test-utils requires a browser environment to run. We can simulate it in Node using jsdom-global:\nnpm install --save-dev jsdom jsdom-global\n\nThen in test/setup.js:\nrequire('jsdom-global')()\n\nThis adds a browser environment to Node, so that vue-test-utils can run correctly.\nPicking an Assertion Library\nChai is a popular assertion library that is commonly used alongside Mocha. You may also want to check out Sinon for creating spies and stubs.\nAlternatively you can use expect which is now part of Jest, and exposes the exact same API in Jest docs.\nWe will be using expect here and make it globally available so that we don't have to import it in every test:\nnpm install --save-dev expect\n\nThen in test/setup.js:\nrequire('jsdom-global')()\n\nglobal.expect = require('expect')\n\nOptimizing Babel for Tests\nNotice that we are using babel-loader to handle JavaScript. You should already have Babel configured if you are using it in your app via a .babelrc file. Here babel-loader will automatically use the same config file.\nOne thing to note is that if you are using Node 6+, which already supports the majority of ES2015 features, you can configure a separate Babel env option that only transpiles features that are not already supported in the Node version you are using (e.g. stage-2 or flow syntax support, etc.).\nAdding a test\nCreate a file in src named Counter.vue:\n\n    \n      {{ count }}\n      Increment\n    \n\n\n\nexport default {\n  data () {\n    return {\n      count: 0\n    }\n  },\n\n  methods: {\n    increment () {\n      this.count++\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nAnd create a test file named test/Counter.spec.js with the following code:\nimport { shallow } from 'vue-test-utils'\nimport Counter from '../src/Counter.vue'\n\ndescribe('Counter.vue', () => {\n  it('increments count when button is clicked', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Counter)\n    wrapper.find('button').trigger('click')\n    expect(wrapper.find('div').text()).toMatch('1')\n  })\n})\n\nAnd now we can run the test:\nnpm run unit\nWoohoo, we got our tests running!\nCoverage\nTo setup code coverage to mocha-webpack, follow the mocha-webpack code coverage guide.\nResources\n\nExample project for this setup\nMocha\nmocha-webpack\nChai\nSinon\njest/expect\n\n"},"guides/using-with-vue-router.html":{"url":"guides/using-with-vue-router.html","title":"Using with Vue Router","keywords":"","body":"Using with Vue Router\nInstalling Vue Router in tests\nYou should never install Vue Router on the Vue base constructor in tests.

It calls Vuex actions.\n\n  \n    \n    Click\n  \n\n\n\nimport { mapActions } from 'vuex'\n\nexport default{\n  methods: {\n    ...mapActions([\n      'actionClick'\n    ]),\n    actionInputIfTrue: function actionInputIfTrue (event) {\n      const inputValue = event.target.value\n      if (inputValue === 'input') {\n        this.$store.dispatch('actionInput', { inputValue })\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nFor the purposes of this test, we don’t care what the actions do, or what the store looks like. We just need to know that these actions are being fired when they should, and that they are fired with the expected value.\nTo test this, we need to pass a mock store to Vue when we shallow our component.\nInstead of passing the store to the base Vue constructor, we can pass it to a - localVue. A localVue is a scoped Vue constructor that we can make changes to without affecting the global Vue constructor.\nLet’s see what this looks like:\nimport { shallow, createLocalVue } from 'vue-test-utils'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport Actions from '../../../src/components/Actions'\n\nconst localVue = createLocalVue()\n\nlocalVue.use(Vuex)\n\ndescribe('Actions.vue', () => {\n  let actions\n  let store\n\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    actions = {\n      actionClick: jest.fn(),\n      actionInput: jest.fn()\n    }\n    store = new Vuex.Store({\n      state: {},\n      actions\n    })\n  })\n\n  it('calls store action \"actionInput\" when input value is \"input\" and an \"input\" event is fired', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Actions, { store, localVue })\n    const input = wrapper.find('input')\n    input.element.value = 'input'\n    input.trigger('input')\n    expect(actions.actionInput).toHaveBeenCalled()\n  })\n\n  it('does not call store action \"actionInput\" when input value is not \"input\" and an \"input\" event is fired', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Actions, { store, localVue })\n    const input = wrapper.find('input')\n    input.element.value = 'not input'\n    input.trigger('input')\n    expect(actions.actionInput).not.toHaveBeenCalled()\n  })\n\n  it('calls store action \"actionClick\" when button is clicked', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Actions, { store, localVue })\n    wrapper.find('button').trigger('click')\n    expect(actions.actionClick).toHaveBeenCalled()\n  })\n})\n\nWhat’s happening here? First we tell Vue to use Vuex with the localVue.use method. This is just a wrapper around Vue.use.\nWe then make a mock store by calling new Vuex.store with our mock values. We only pass it the actions, since that’s all we care about.\nThe actions are jest mock functions. These mock functions give us methods to assert whether the actions were called or not.\nWe can then assert in our tests that the action stub was called when expected.\nNow the way we define the store might look a bit foreign to you.\nWe’re using beforeEach to ensure we have a clean store before each test. beforeEach is a mocha hook that’s called before each test. In our test, we are reassigning the store variables value. If we didn’t do this, the mock functions would need to be automatically reset. It also lets us change the state in our tests, without it affecting later tests.\nThe most important thing to note in this test is that we create a mock Vuex store and then pass it to vue-test-utils.\nGreat, so now we can mock actions, let’s look at mocking getters.\nMocking Getters\n\n  \n    {{inputValue}}\n    {{clicks}}\n  \n\n\n\nimport { mapGetters } from 'vuex'\n\nexport default{\n  computed: mapGetters([\n    'clicks',\n    'inputValue'\n  ])\n}\n\n\nThis is a fairly simple component. It renders the result of the getters clicks and inputValue. Again, we don’t really care about what those getters returns – just that the result of them is being rendered correctly.\nLet’s see the test:\nimport { shallow, createLocalVue } from 'vue-test-utils'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport Actions from '../../../src/components/Getters'\n\nconst localVue = createLocalVue()\n\nlocalVue.use(Vuex)\n\ndescribe('Getters.vue', () => {\n  let getters\n  let store\n\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    getters = {\n      clicks: () => 2,\n      inputValue: () => 'input'\n    }\n\n    store = new Vuex.Store({\n      getters\n    })\n  })\n\n  it('Renders \"state.inputValue\" in first p tag', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Actions, { store, localVue })\n    const p = wrapper.find('p')\n    expect(p.text()).toBe(getters.inputValue())\n  })\n\n  it('Renders \"state.clicks\" in second p tag', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Actions, { store, localVue })\n    const p = wrapper.findAll('p').at(1)\n    expect(p.text()).toBe(getters.clicks().toString())\n  })\n})\n\nThis test is similar to our actions test. We create a mock store before each test, pass it as an option when we call shallow, and assert that the value returned by our mock getters is being rendered.\nThis is great, but what if we want to check our getters are returning the correct part of our state?\nMocking with Modules\nModules are useful for separating out our store into manageable chunks. They also export getters. We can use these in our tests.\nLet’s look at our component:\n\n  \n    Click\n    {{moduleClicks}}\n  \n\n\n\nimport { mapActions, mapGetters } from 'vuex'\n\nexport default{\n  methods: {\n    ...mapActions([\n      'moduleActionClick'\n    ])\n  },\n\n  computed: mapGetters([\n    'moduleClicks'\n  ])\n}\n\n\nSimple component that includes one action and one getter.\nAnd the test:\nimport { shallow, createLocalVue } from 'vue-test-utils'\nimport Vuex from 'vuex'\nimport Modules from '../../../src/components/Modules'\nimport module from '../../../src/store/module'\n\nconst localVue = createLocalVue()\n\nlocalVue.use(Vuex)\n\ndescribe('Modules.vue', () => {\n  let actions\n  let state\n  let store\n\n  beforeEach(() => {\n    state = {\n      module: {\n        clicks: 2\n      }\n    }\n\n    actions = {\n      moduleActionClick: jest.fn()\n    }\n\n    store = new Vuex.Store({\n      state,\n      actions,\n      getters: module.getters\n    })\n  })\n\n  it('calls store action \"moduleActionClick\" when button is clicked', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Modules, { store, localVue })\n    const button = wrapper.find('button')\n    button.trigger('click')\n    expect(actions.moduleActionClick).toHaveBeenCalled()\n  })\n\n  it('Renders \"state.inputValue\" in first p tag', () => {\n    const wrapper = shallow(Modules, { store, localVue })\n    const p =
